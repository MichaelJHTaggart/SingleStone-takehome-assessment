### Details on project && throughput

I really learned a lot through this assessment. I have never downloaded a font and used @font-face before, used testing on a project, or had ran into the specific typescript issue I was having.

Through each problem I didn't contact anyone for outside help. I did research, and figured out the solution on my own. I really had fun on this project! Can't wait to start learning more about unit testing!

I received this project on April 27, 2022
I tracked my hours of time spent:
 - Total Time Spent: 13 hours 23 minutes
 - Reading instructions, Planning, and Setup: 48 min.
 - Coding: ~7 hours
